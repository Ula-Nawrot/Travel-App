# Travel-Website - it allows to book hotels in Europe
## Motivation
This is a project for postgraduate studies at Wroclaw School of Banking. The main language I used in Java Script. I decided to use this language to learn and understand it, because frameworks like React, Angular and Typescript are based on it.
## Description


## How to open it
You have to open this link: [Travel Website](https://ula-nawrot.github.io/Travel-App/)

**!!!Important!!!**
The API for hotels is hosted on Heroku, which after 30 minutes of inactivity (no requests to the API) puts the Web Service to sleep, which in the case of Heroku requests wakes it up, which can take several seconds.  So in can of alert with message "TypeError: Failed to fetch", try again in a few seconds.

## Resources
* To create this project, I used the knowledge I gained during studies at the Wroc≈Çaw School of Banking, specialization: Front-end developer. * I also finished a course on Udemy: The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!

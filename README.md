# Travel Website
## Motivation
This is a project for postgraduate studies at Wroclaw School of Banking. The main language I used in Java Script. It is one of the most
[popular scripting languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) which influenced my motivation to explore its secrets. The fact that with JS you can write both frontend and backend applications is its additional advantage.
## How to open it
You have to open this link: [Travel Website](https://ula-nawrot.github.io/Travel-App/)

**!!!Important!!!**

The API for hotels is hosted on Heroku, which after 30 minutes of inactivity (no requests to the API) puts the Web Service to sleep, which in the case of Heroku requests wakes it up, which can take several seconds.  So in case of alert with message **"TypeError: Failed to fetch", try again in a few seconds.**
## Description
The Travel Website allows to book hotels in different cities in Europe in chosen time range
